## Security Implementations against Cyberattacks

The implementations listed to protect the GlobalTrust Bank international payment portal from various cyberattacks are well-rounded and effective in addressing common vulnerabilities.

1. Session Hijacking
Attack Description: Session hijacking occurs when an attacker steals a user's session ID to gain unauthorized access to the user's account without needing login credentials.
Prevention: HTTPS & SSL (Valid Certificate and Key):
Effectiveness: HTTPS encrypts all communication between the userâ€™s browser and the server, ensuring that sensitive session information is protected during transmission. SSL certificates authenticate the server and establish encrypted connections, preventing attackers from intercepting or tampering with session cookies or other sensitive data.
Why It Works: Even if an attacker attempts to intercept the traffic, the encrypted session data is unreadable, protecting it from being hijacked.

2. Clickjacking
Attack Description: Clickjacking tricks users into clicking on something different from what they perceive, often through invisible or disguised UI elements, leading them to unknowingly execute malicious actions.
Prevention: X-Frame Options HTTP Header:
Effectiveness: The X-Frame-Options HTTP header prevents the portal from being embedded into an iframe on other websites, which is a common method used in clickjacking attacks.
Why It Works: By denying the ability to embed the site, this header ensures that attackers canâ€™t overlay hidden buttons or trick users into interacting with invisible elements that could execute malicious commands.

3. SQL Injection Attacks
Attack Description: SQL injection occurs when an attacker inserts or manipulates SQL queries through user input fields to access, modify, or delete data from the database.
Prevention: User Input Validation & Sanitation (express-validator):
Effectiveness: Input validation ensures that only expected and correctly formatted data is accepted. Express-validator sanitizes inputs by stripping out potentially harmful characters and patterns before processing them.
Why It Works: This blocks malicious SQL code from being injected into database queries, effectively preventing unauthorized access or manipulation of the database.

4. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
Attack Description: XSS allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users, potentially stealing cookies, session information, or executing unauthorized actions.
Prevention: Input Validation & Sanitation (express-validator and validator.js), RegEx:
Effectiveness: Input validation and sanitation ensure that any potentially dangerous input, such as scripts, is filtered out before being processed by the system. Validator.js and regular expressions (RegEx) are used to further tighten input control by ensuring that only valid data formats are accepted.
Why It Works: These measures prevent the execution of unauthorized scripts, protecting users from inadvertently triggering malicious code on the portal.

5. Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks
Attack Description: MITM attacks occur when an attacker intercepts communication between two parties, potentially altering or stealing transmitted data.
Prevention: HTTPS Encryption, SSL (Valid Certificate and Key):
Effectiveness: HTTPS and SSL encrypt all communication, ensuring that even if an attacker intercepts the data, they cannot read or alter it.
Why It Works: Encryption scrambles the data, making it incomprehensible to any unauthorized party attempting to listen in on the communication.

6. Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) Attacks
Attack Description: DDoS attacks overwhelm a server with excessive traffic, causing it to slow down or crash, disrupting access for legitimate users.
Prevention: Rate Limiting, Whitelisting:
Effectiveness: Rate limiting restricts the number of requests a user can make to the server within a specific time frame, preventing bots or malicious actors from flooding the system with traffic. Whitelisting allows only trusted IP addresses or users to access certain areas of the system.
Why It Works: Rate limiting helps mitigate the impact of a DDoS attack by controlling traffic, while whitelisting ensures only authorized users are granted access, reducing the risk of attacks from unknown sources.

Additional Security Measures:
Password Security (Hashing and Salting):

Effectiveness: Hashing transforms a password into a fixed-length, unreadable string. Salting adds an additional unique value to the password before hashing, ensuring that even identical passwords have unique hashes.
Why It Works: This prevents attackers from deciphering passwords even if they manage to gain access to the password database. It also protects against rainbow table attacks, where precomputed hash values are used to reverse-engineer passwords.
Whitelisting with RegEx Patterns:

Effectiveness: Whitelisting ensures that only known, valid input formats are accepted by the system. Regular expressions (RegEx) are used to define acceptable patterns for various inputs (e.g., email addresses, account numbers).
Why It Works: This approach drastically reduces the attack surface by rejecting any input that does not strictly conform to expected formats, making it harder for attackers to inject malicious code.
All Traffic Served Over SSL:

Effectiveness: Serving all traffic over SSL guarantees that data transmitted between users and the portal is encrypted, ensuring confidentiality and integrity.
Why It Works: Even if an attacker manages to intercept traffic, they wonâ€™t be able to read or tamper with the encrypted data, protecting sensitive information like user credentials and payment details.

These layered security measures are highly effective in defending the GlobalTrust Bank international payment portal from a wide range of attacks. By implementing encryption, input validation, rate limiting, and secure password storage, the system is better equipped to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of both user data and payment transactions.
